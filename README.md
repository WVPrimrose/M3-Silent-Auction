# M3-Silent-Auction

The goal to recreate the silent auction website for M3 using a custom landing page, forms, and tables for 
parents fill out.  At the same time, parents want to track their bids using the data stored in the forms in 
the tables.  

On the administrative side, I want to provide tables.  That way, we know if the items are claimed, and if 
they're not claimed, sort if the items are either going to be delivered to the parents' homes or picked-up at 
the Buchholz residence.

### User Story:
AS a parent,
I want an online silent auction,
SO THAT I can bid anytime and see the items and current bids before the actual silent auction event.

### User Story:
AS a board member or M3 staff member,
I want an online silent auction,
SO THAT we can reach to current M3 followers (former campers and families, donors, etc.), organize item 
inventory (where they're going to whom, remaining items after event, item bids, etc.).

### Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN an online silent auction,
WHEN I view the landing page,
THEN I see the M3 title page; links to bidder contact form, each items' bidding sheets, M3 website, and M3
social media; an acknowledgement paragraph about supporting M3, and instructions about the silent auction.
WHEN I view the forms,
THEN I can fill out my contact information, go back to the landing page, and view current bids.
WHEN I submit the forms,
THEN I'm taken to an acknowledgement page to either go back to the landing page and/or view current bids.
WHEN I view the current bids,
THEN I view a table featuring the indivual item name, the bidder's name, and their bid.
